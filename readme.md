# ISCPP - Improved Sophos Central Partner Center

This project aims to leverage the Sophos Central API to develop a tool that addresses some missing features that could benefit MSPs. 
Additionally, it seeks to integrate with PSA systems to enhance billing processes.

[You ask why](https://github.com/xasz/ISCPP/wiki)

This is software is still in alpha, but have passed some first live tests.
Thanks to the testers and there feedback.

I understand there is still much work to be done, but I wanted to release ISCPP to allow users to start benefiting from its features and provide valuable feedback. Your input will help shape the future of this project and ensure it meets the needs of its users effectively.
